# RaspberryPiStreamingCamera
This project uses the Raspberry Pi Camera. The image will be streamed in H.264 over the integrated RTSP Server.
This project is meant to be very secure, therefore we renounce e.g. on a web interface, which whould provides an attack area.

## Build:
![Travis Status failure](https://travis-ci.org/florian-asche/RaspberryPiStreamingCamera.svg?branch=master)
Thanks to https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen for the Image Buildprocess.

## Used Software by this project:
* Raspbian Jessie (minmal) image.
* The UV4L software from http://www.linux-projects.org
* The RTSP server from https://github.com/mpromonet/h264_v4l2_rtspserver

## Hardware Tips:
* You can buy a Raspberry Pi Zero (very small) with Wirless Onboard and a Housing here: https://buyzero.de/collections/boards-kits/products/copy-of-raspberry-pi-zero-w?variant=31485043090
* All other nesessary things you can also get there. 
* With that hardware setup you get 25FPS in 720p H264 over RTSP.

## Howto:
* Unzip your downloaded image, and write it to SD card with win32 disk imager.
* Place a ```wpa_supplicant.conf``` file on the boot partition to connect the camera with you WIFI. Consider multiple AP for am more stable communication in case an AP goes down.
* The Raspberry Pi is configured for DHCP and will therefore retrieve an IP address
* SSH is enabled by default. The default login is: username ```'pi'``` and password ```'raspberry'```. !!! You need to change that. !!!
* If you can access the PI with ssh you should be able to connect the RTSP Server (for example with vlc) with URL ```rtsp://<PI-IP-ADDRESS>:8554```

## What is handled by the installation files?
* Enable camera
* Preparing Raspbian - Regenerate security keys (best practice)
* Preparing Raspbian - Enable ssh
* Update System
* Install UV4L components
* Install the RTSP server
* Cleanup unneeded packages from disk to make the image size smaller for redistribution
* Readonly - Remove rsyslog and install a memory resident variant
* Readonly - configure the boot options to be read-only on next boot

## Build your own image:
* checkout this repository
* install files from depends
* ./build.sh

## Install script manually on existing device:
* checkout this repository
```shell
git clone git@github.com:florian-asche/RaspberryPiStreamingCamera.git
```
* goto stage3 directory
```shell
cd stage3
```
* Enable camera
```shell
cd 00-raspberrypistreamingcamera-enable_camera/files/
./script.sh
cd ..
```
* Install Software and configure them
```shell
cd 01-raspberrypistreamingcamera-software_and_config
./01-run.sh
cd ..
```
* Cleanup (If you dont want Readonly or Buildfiles removed, you can skip this)
```shell
cd 02-raspberrypistreamingcamera-cleanup
./01-run.sh
cd ..
```
* Make device read only (If you dont want Readonly or Buildfiles removed, you can skip this)
```shell
cd 04-raspberrypistreamingcamera-make_readonly
./01-run.sh
cd ..
```
